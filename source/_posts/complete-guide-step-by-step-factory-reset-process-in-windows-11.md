### Method 6: Reset or reinstall synchronization tools

 Tools like OneDrive or Dropbox sometimes take a lot of resources to synchronize all files. In some cases they get stuck and they overload your hard drive and push the disk usage to 100%. This problem happens when they are still trying to synchronize files after the process is done.

To reset OneDrive for example you can do the following:

1. Press**Windows Key + R**
2. Enter the command`%localappdata%\Microsoft\OneDrive\onedrive.exe /reset`

This should fix the issue and your disk usage should go back to normal.

### Method 7: Rebuild the Windows Search index

 Windows Search helps you find files, folders, or anything on your hard drive. To do that it scans your hard drive and turns into a super-fast index to show you your desired results.

 In some cases, the search feature can create issues as it keeps on indexing that can cause 100% disk usage and harm your hard drives’ performance.

To solve this problem you can rebuild the index:

1. Click on the Windows “Start Menu” button and in the search bar type –`indexing`  
![search index](<https://f057a20f961f56a72089-b74530d2d26278124f446233f95622ef.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/site/blog/fix-disk-usage/method7> - step1.png)
2. Select “Indexing Options” in the search results. Click on “Advanced” and hit the “Rebuild” button.  
![Indexing Options](<https://f057a20f961f56a72089-b74530d2d26278124f446233f95622ef.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/site/blog/fix-disk-usage/method7> - step2.png)

 This will erase and rebuilt the index and fix the errors that are behind the 100% disk usage in Windows 10

![Command Prompt](https://f057a20f961f56a72089-b74530d2d26278124f446233f95622ef.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/site/blog/fix-disk-usage/method-10-.png)

 This will temporarily stop Window search from running until the next time Windows is restarted.

 If you discover that Windows search is the reason behind your Windows 10 reaching 100% disk usage, you can disable it permanently by doing the following:

1. Press**Windows Key + R** . Type`service.msc` and hit**Enter**
2. In the Service window select Windows Search entry and double-click it to update its properties.
3. Select**Disable** under Startup type and then click**OK** .

### Method 11: Remove temporary files

[Deleting your temporary files](https://store.revouninstaller.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=28010250&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1) as we have covered in our previous article, can help you prevent issues. In some rare cases, bugs with temporary files can cause a Windows process or application to create a lot of files and increase your disk usage to 100%.

 Deleting the temporary files is a solution you need to look into to fix the problem.

## So what if the 100% disk usage in Windows 10 issue persists?

 If you can’t solve your 100% disk usage with the above methods, that means that you probably have to replace your hard drive. Your hard drive should never be at 100% usage. In case it is constantly showing this number there is some reason for the condition. If you don’t address the issue you are risking having a very slow computer.
