## Lenovo Unveils the Future of Portable Computing: The Revolutionary L-Series Lineup

Lenovo is introducing a new selection ThinkPad L and X-series professional laptops. All six of the new laptops feature Intel Core Ultra processors and start at prices below $1,400\. Notably, this also marks the launch of Lenovo's ThinkPad L16, the first 16-inch laptop in the L series.

 There are four new laptops in the ThinkPad L series—the ThinkPad L16 Gen 1, ThinkPad L14 Gen 5, ThinkPad L13 Gen 5, and the ThinkPad L13 2-in-1 Gen 5\. All four of these laptops are powered by the Intel Core Ultra processor. [Intel Core Ultra](https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/elevate-your-profiles-visual-appeal-for-2024/) is a relatively minor improvement over Intel's previous CPU design, though it provides a boost in AI processing and reduces the battery impact of AI tasks. Of course, Lenovo also offers AMD Ryzen PRO 7030 versions of the 16 and 14-inch laptop models.

 Spec-wise, the new ThinkPad L16 Gen 1 and L14 Gen 5 are basically identical. Both laptops can be configured with up to 64GB of DDR5 RAM and a maximum 2TB PCIe storage. They also have an upgraded in-keyboard fingerprint sensor, Wi-Fi 7 connectivity (Intel configs only), and optional 4G LTE. As for the port selection, it's as good as ever. You get a single TB4 port, a USB-C port, three USB-A ports, and an HDMI 2.1 jack.

 Lenovo also managed to make the ThinkPad L16 and L14 more repairable. Both devices achieved a 9 out of 10 repairability score from iFixit and do not use soldered-on RAM or storage modules. Repairability was a highlight of the recently announced [ThinkPad T14 Gen 5 and T16 Gen 3](https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-embarking-on-a-virtual-odyssey-through-yt-stories/), and we're glad to see that Lenovo is extending this consumer-friendly design to other products.

 However, the L14 Gen 5 may provide a better overall experience, as its display contains a brightness-enhancing 3M Optical Film that effectively reduces power consumption by up to 16%.

 The new ThinkPad L13 Gen 5 is more modest than its siblings. It contains up to 32GB LPDDR5 RAM and can be configured with 1TB of PCIe storage. Connectivity is locked at Wi-Fi 6E, which is perfectly acceptable, and 4G LTE is once again an optional upgrade. Thankfully, this 13-inch model matches the port selection of its larger siblings and has an in-body fingerprint sensor. Lenovo lists the same specs for its ThinkPad L13 2-in-1 Gen 5 laptop.

 Those who need more power from a 13-inch laptop should opt for the new ThinkPad X13 Gen 5\. It uses Intel Core Ultra processors with Intel vPro and can be configured with integrated Arc graphics. Plus, you get a maximum 64GB LPDDR5 RAM, 2TB of PCIe storage, Wi-Fi 7 connectivity, and optional LTE or 5G. The only drawback is the port selection, which is trimmed down to a single TB4 port, a pair of USB-A ports, and an HDMI 2.1 jack.

 There's also the ThinkPad X13 2-in-1 Gen 5\. It matches the ThinkPad X13's specs but uses Intel Xe graphics, rather than Intel Arc. It also comes with a stylus, unlike the new L-series 2-in-1.

 Lenovo will begin shipping its new laptops in Q2 of 2024 (sometime between April and June). Intel versions of the ThinkPad L16 and L14 start at $1,179, while AMD versions start at just $999\. The ThinkPad L13 and 2-in-1 L13 will cost $1,199 and $1,319, respectively. Customers who purchase the X13 laptop will pay the most money—the ThinkPad X13 and its 2-in-1 counterpart start at $1,239 and $1,399.
