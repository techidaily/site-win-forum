## What is the “Something Didn’t Go As Planned” error and why you can encounter it

 The “Something Didn’t Go As Planned” error is a common occurrence that Windows 11 users may encounter while using their computers. This error message typically appears when an unexpected issue arises during the execution of a task or operation on the operating system. While the error message itself doesn’t provide much information about the specific cause of the problem, there are several common factors that can contribute to its occurrence.

1. ### Software conflicts  

 One of the primary reasons for the “Something Didn’t Go As Planned” error is conflicts between different software applications or services running on the system. This can happen when two or more programs try to access the same system resources simultaneously, resulting in an unexpected error. Incompatibilities between certain software versions or outdated drivers can also lead to conflicts and trigger this error.
2. ### Corrupted system files  
 System files play a crucial role in the proper functioning of Windows 11\. If any of these essential files become corrupted or damaged, it can result in errors like “Something Didn’t Go As Planned.” Corrupted system files can occur due to various reasons, including malware infections, improper system shutdowns, or hardware failures.
3. ### Hardware issues  
 Sometimes, hardware problems can contribute to the occurrence of this error. Faulty or incompatible hardware components, such as RAM modules, hard drives, or graphics cards, can cause unexpected errors while the system is running. These hardware issues may trigger the “Something Didn’t Go As Planned” error, especially during resource-intensive tasks or when specific hardware drivers are being accessed.
4. ### Insufficient system resources  
 If your computer lacks the necessary system resources to perform a particular task, it can lead to errors. Insufficient RAM, limited disk space, or a high CPU usage can all contribute to the occurrence of the “Something Didn’t Go As Planned” error. This often happens when running multiple demanding applications simultaneously or attempting to perform resource-intensive operations.
5. ### Operating system updates  
 Windows 11 is a relatively new operating system, and as with any software, it may have certain bugs or compatibility issues that can trigger error messages. When Microsoft releases updates for Windows 11, it aims to address these issues and improve the system’s stability. However, sometimes the update process itself can encounter errors, leading to the “Something Didn’t Go As Planned” error.

   2. Select Troubleshoot from the left-hand side menu.  
   3. Click on Additional Troubleshooters

   4. Disable all the startup applications one by one.  
   5. Restart your computer, and check if the error persists.
6. Use System File Checker (SFC) and DISM: Corrupted system files can lead to various errors in Windows, including the “Something Didn’t Go As Planned” error. To fix this, you can use the built-in System File Checker (SFC) and Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) tools. Open Command Prompt as an administrator, then run the following commands one by one:

   ![command prompt](https://f057a20f961f56a72089-b74530d2d26278124f446233f95622ef.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/site/blog/something-didnt-go-as-planned-error/method-6-command-prompt-1.jpg)  
   * dism /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth  
   ![command prompt](https://f057a20f961f56a72089-b74530d2d26278124f446233f95622ef.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/site/blog/something-didnt-go-as-planned-error/method-6-command-prompt-2.jpg)  
Wait for the process to complete and restart your computer.

8. Reinstall Windows 11: If all else fails, you may need to consider reinstalling Windows 11\. Before proceeding with a reinstallation, make sure to back up your important files and data. You can create a bootable USB drive with the Windows 11 installation media and follow the on-screen instructions to reinstall the operating system.

 It’s important to note that these troubleshooting steps are general suggestions and may not resolve the “Something Didn’t Go As Planned” error in every case. If you are still experiencing the issue after trying these steps, it may be helpful to seek assistance from Microsoft support or the Windows community forums, where experts can provide more specific guidance based on your situation.
