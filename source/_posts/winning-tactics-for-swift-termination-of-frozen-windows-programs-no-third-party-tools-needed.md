### Method 11: Run a full Windows Defender scan

 As most of us know malware can be very bad for our PC. It can be the reason behind many error messages, it can also prevent many apps from running or from being installed.

 In order to be sure that your system is not infected with malware perform a full system scan with Windows Defender.

1. Open the Start Menu and type Windows Defender and open the tool
2. In the left-hand pane, select the shield icon
3. In the new window select “**Advanced scan** “
4. Check the “full scan” option to launch a full system scan

### Method 12: Update your Windows 10 Operating System

 If some of your apps can’t run on your PC, maybe the issue is that your Windows OS is not running the latest version.

To update your Windows:

1. Open the**Start Menu** and click on**PC Settings**
2. In the search bar type “**Windows Updates** “
3. Click on the “**Check for Updates** ” button  
![check for updates](https://f057a20f961f56a72089-b74530d2d26278124f446233f95622ef.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/site/blog/fix-this-app-cant-run/Method-12-step3.jpg)
