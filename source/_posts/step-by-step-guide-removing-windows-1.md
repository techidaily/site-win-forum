 Wake on Lan is a very neat Windows 10 and Windows 11 feature, that does not get much attention. Used by network administrators for years, this feature allows the user to remotely turn on their PCs. You can use it at home too, to remotely get wake up your PC via the Internet.

## First let’s discover what exactly is Wake on LAN in Windows 10/11

 As mentioned above Wake on LAN give you the power to turn on/off your computer remotely. By using the Ethernet connector a small “magic” packet is sent to the BIOS. This alters it to turn the PC on. For this feature to be active you need to connect your computer to the router using a wired Ethernet cable.

 As smart homes setups become more popular, Wake on LAN can be super handy. You can set up a voice command to turn on your PC using Google Assistant or Alexa.
