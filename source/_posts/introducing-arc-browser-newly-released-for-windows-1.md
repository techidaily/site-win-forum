## Introducing Arc Browser - Newly Released for Windows 1

Arc, a free web browser developed by The Browser Company, is now available on Windows 10\. The only caveat is that it doesn't work on Windows 10 build 1809, which Microsoft doesnâ€™t support either.

 Arc for Windows 11 [arrived in April 2024](https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-top-12-no-cost-high-end-video-apps-for-seamless-viewing-experience-pc-and-tabletsmartphone/), and now the browser includes support for Windows 10 as well. According to this support page, your Intel or AMD processor must support the x86 BMI2 instruction set for Arc to run on Windows 10\. That's perfectly fine, as those chips are older than Intel Haswell, AMD Athlon, or AMD Ryzen.

 At the same time, an Arm64 version of Arc is being developed and is "coming soon" to [Windows on ARM](https://fox-http.techidaily.com/essential-list-best-microphones-for-4k-ultra-hd/) systems. If you have a Snapdragon X-powered PC, this version of Arc will run natively instead of through Microsoft's Windows on ARM x86 emulator, dubbed Prism.

 Arc is a new Chromium-based browser released in April 2022 that supports Chrome browser extensions from the Chrome Web Store out of the box. The app comes with [some interesting integrations](https://arc.net/integrations), like the ability to change visual elements of any page, with built-in apps hosted in a sidebar. In addition to Windows 10, Arc is available on iOS, iPadOS, macOS, iOS, and Windows 11\. Linux and Android are unsupported at the moment, but you can sign up for an [Android waitlist](https://browserco.typeform.com/to/i5p2MBU5) or a [Windows on ARM waitlist](https://browserco.typeform.com/Arc-Windows-ARM) to stay informed about when those versions will become available.

 Due to Apple's requirements, the iOS and iPadOS versions use Safari's WebKit layout engine. However, that could change for customers in the European Union, where Apple now permits third-party browsers with custom engines. For further information about the browser and what you can do with it, be sure to [peruse our Arc review](https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/the-art-of-sharing-horizontals-in-igtvs-vertical-world/).

 You can [download Arc](https://arc.net/) from the official website.
