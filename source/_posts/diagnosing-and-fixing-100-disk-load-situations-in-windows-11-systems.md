### Check for the uninstallation file in the Program Folder

 The majority of your software installations are located in C:\\Program Files or C:\\Program Files(x86). In the installation folder, there should be a file(uninstall.exe) that contains the uninstaller script. If you try to uninstall this program through Control Panel, Windows calls the same script.

 In case that the software is not listed in Control Panel, navigate to the folder of the program you are trying to uninstall and run the uninstall.exe file. This should remove the program from your PC.

2. Select the Registry key of the installed program.
3. Click**Rename** on the Edit menu, and then use a name with less than 60 characters.
