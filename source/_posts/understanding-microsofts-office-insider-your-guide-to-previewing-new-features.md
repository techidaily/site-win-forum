 You may have heard about the Office Insider program or read about [new Microsoft Office application features](https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/android-unlock-code-sim-unlock-your-realme-12-proplus-5g-phone-and-remove-locked-screen-by-drfone-android/) available only to Office Insiders. If you're curious and possibly interested in becoming an Insider, here's everything you need to know.

 Microsoft now calls this [the Microsoft 365 Insider Program](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/join-the-microsoft-365-insider-program-3c7dda4f-4d05-0783-3a9a-182b50acb8a9).

##  What is the Office Insider Program?

 The [Office Insider program](https://insider.office.com/) is a service that provides early access to new features for Microsoft Office applications like Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook. To join the program, you'll need a [subscription version of Office](https://www.reviewgeek.com/72454/microsoft-office-vs-microsoft-365-which-one-should-you-buy/).

 When you're an Insider, instead of using the current public versions of the applications, you install builds that contain the new features. This gives you the opportunity to try out those new features and then provide feedback to Microsoft. These new features can have bugs, and if you decide you don't want to participate anymore, you can always opt-out of the program again.

Related: [What Is Microsoft 365?](https://games-able.techidaily.com/ultimate-console-content-psplus-or-xbox-game-pass/) 

 You'll need a [Microsoft 365](https://games-able.techidaily.com/ultimate-console-content-psplus-or-xbox-game-pass/) Personal or Family subscription to install the builds. If you have a subscription through your work or school, you'll need your Microsoft 365 administrator to assist you with receiving the builds.

##  Which Systems and Apps Are Supported?

 You can join the program using a Windows, Mac, Android, or iOS Office supported device. Review the [system requirements for Microsoft 365](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/microsoft-365-and-office-resources?rtc=1) and those for [specifically for Office Mobile apps](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/microsoft-365-and-office-resources?rtc=1#coreui-heading-3b8v07b).

 The supported applications for the Office Insider program depend on your platform. The applications can include Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, Outlook, Access, Project, and Visio.

* Windows includes all applications.
* Mac includes all applications except for Access, Project, and Visio.
* Android and iOS include all applications except for Outlook, Access, Project, and Visio.

###  Beta Channel

 This channel provides you with the latest builds which are released frequently. It's intended for those who want to help identify problems and offer feedback. The features are still in development and the builds are unsupported.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
###  Windows

 Go to File > Account and select the Office Insider drop-down menu. Choose "Change Level" and uncheck the box at the top for Sign Me Up For Early Access to New Releases of Office. Select "OK" and confirm if prompted.

![Unchecked box to Opt Out on Windows](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/OptOutWindows-OfficeInsiderProgram.png)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
###  Mac

 Open an Office application and select Help > Check for Updates from the menu bar. Uncheck the box for joining the Office Insider program.

 As of this writing in July 2022, we are unable to find the check box for this option as [Microsoft describes](https://insider.office.com/en-us/handbook#Opt-out-or-change-channels), neither in the main window or Advanced options. You can, however, switch channels to "Current Channel" in the Advanced options, and that may revert your installation to the traditional experience.

![Check for Updates without checkbox on Mac](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/NoCheckboxMac-OfficeInsiderProgram.png)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
###  Android

 Visit the app testing program page for each of the applications and pick "Leave the Program." Then uninstall the Office Insider versions of the apps and install the public versions from Google Play.

###  iPhone

 Follow the Opt Out From Testing section of the [TestFlight app documentation](https://developer.apple.com/testflight/). Basically, select the app in TestFlight, choose "Stop Testing," and confirm.

 The Office Insider program is a great way to get a peek at new features on the way to public users. Just keep in mind that the application versions you'll be using aren't final releases.
