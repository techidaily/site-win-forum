## What did we add in the new 5.0.0 version of Revo Uninstaller Pro?

### Uninstall History module

 With Revo Uninstaller Pro 5 you can now view your uninstall history. The goal is to let our users keep track of all of the completed uninstall operations.

### Command-Line support for Windows Apps and Browser Extensions

 In the latest release of Revo Uninstaller, we’ve made a few changes to the Windows Apps module. Aside from having the ability to uninstall Windows Apps via the standard graphical user interface, we’ve also added the choice of uninstalling them via the command-line interface (CLI).

 There is also now an option to remove Browser Extensions. You can do this from the Command-Line interface. Supported are all of the most popular browsers.

 With the Improved Autorun Manager, you can see a list of Windows Apps and manage their automatic startup for better System Boot speed.

### Improved leftover and scanning speed

 Another major improvement we’ve made is to reduce the loading times when loading and scanning for leftovers. The speed is improved by up to 30-50%. This is especially noticeable when uninstalling large programs.
