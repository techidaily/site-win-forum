## I. Disable startup programs in Windows 11

 Windows 11 comes with several programs that start automatically with the operating system. While some of these programs may be useful, others can slow down your computer’s startup and take up valuable resources. Disabling unnecessary startup programs can help speed up your Windows 11 boot time. This is how you can disable them:

1. Press**Windows + I** to open Windows**Settings** .
2. Click the**Apps** tab from the sidebar and tap on**Startup** in the right-hand pane to view all your startup apps.

3. Finally, toggle the switch next to the apps you don’t want to run at startup. Under the toggle switch, you’ll see the status impact of each, which indicates what disabling them does to your system.

8. Click**Save changes** to apply the changes.

## IV. Defragment your hard drive

 If you are experiencing slow boot times on your Windows 11 computer, one possible cause could be a fragmented hard drive.

 Defragmenting your hard drive in Windows 11 is a simple process. Here are the steps to follow:

1. Press the Windows key + S to open the search bar.
2. Type in “Defragment and Optimize Drives” and select it from the search results.
3. Select the hard drive you want to defragment.  
![defragment hard drive](https://f057a20f961f56a72089-b74530d2d26278124f446233f95622ef.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/site/blog/speed-up-windows-11-boot-time/defragment-your-hard-drive-step-3.png)
4. Click on the Optimize button.
5. Wait for the defragmentation process to complete.

## V. Use an SSD

 If you have a modern PC running Windows 11, chances are that it uses an SSD (Solid State Drive), which is faster than a traditional hard disk drive. However, if you’re experiencing slow boot times, upgrading to a new SSD can help improve your boot time.

 In addition to upgrading your SSD, another way to speed up your PC’s boot time is to upgrade your RAM. With more RAM, your PC will have more volatile memory available to load temporary items, resulting in faster boot times and an overall improvement in your PC’s performance.
