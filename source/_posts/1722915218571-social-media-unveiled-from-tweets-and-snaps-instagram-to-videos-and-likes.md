 Running low on drive space on your PC can lower your computer’s performance significantly. As your drives fill up with various files, your compter’s speed will slow down. This will affect all the daily activities that you perform – web browsing, streaming videos or simply checking your email.

 But don’t fret! If you are running Microsoft Windows 11, you have an easy way out of this situation.

 Windows 11 has several neat settings that you can use to get rid of temporary and system files or any other files that can fill up your storage space. Note that your important files will be safe as Windows 11 helps you decide what you need to delete to improve the performance of your computer.
