## But how to start this feature?

 You can easily find the “Hunter Mode” option, on the last position of the features in the left part of Revo Uninstaller’s user interface.  
 It can be easily recognized as for the reason that it resembles a target ![hunter-mode-icon](https://f057a20f961f56a72089-b74530d2d26278124f446233f95622ef.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/site/blog/hunter-mode/hunter-mode-icon.png)

 As you might already guess Hunter Mode offers one-click uninstall, stop or delete of a program just by pointing an application on the desktop. This can be very useful because a lot of applications are loading on start-up and stay in the system tray without your agreement. And that’s not all. You can control the auto-start of applications, and kill or delete a current process. Hunter Mode is your even more direct access to the removal of unnecessary software. It is inferior in no way to the normal Uninstaller Feature, which works at an extremely comprehensive, and in-depth level.

* Uninstall the application with a single click on the application icon
* Stop Auto-Starting of the application
* Kill process
* Kill and delete process
* Open the application containing the folder
* Search the application name in Google.
* See detailed information about the program- like size, date of creation, location, and more.
