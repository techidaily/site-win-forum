3. After that press**Enter**

Lets’ see this example to clarify the whole process:

 You want to delete a file called_Info.txt_ that is located on your desktop. Use the following command in the Command Prompt where you replace username with your own username:

**Del “C:\\Users\\username\\Desktop\\Info.txt”**

After you enter this command the file will be deleted from the Desktop.

 There are several commands that you can use to modify a bit the del command.

 For instance, you can add the /p parameter to the command to get Command Prompt to be asked for confirmation before deleting a file.

You can also add the /f parameter to force delete a read-only file.

 You can also use Revo Uninstallers’[force uninstall feature](https://store.revouninstaller.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=28010250&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1) if you have trouble removing stubborn programs.
