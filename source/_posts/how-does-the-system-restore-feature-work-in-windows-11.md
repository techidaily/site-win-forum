## First let’s discover what the Windows DNS cache does

 DNS stands for Domain Network System. The main role of the DNS is to translate familiar domain names like revouninstaller.com into IP addresses computers use to connect with each other. For example, if you want to connect to google.com, your computer queries a DNS server on the internet to get the corresponding IP address connected to the google.com domain. Windows 10 and Windows 11 store a copy of the information it gets from the DNS server on your PC, so the process can be faster.

## When will you have to flush your DNS cache

 Most of the systems connected to the internet automatically update the cache and hostnames, you can have problems when the IP address of a webpage changes before the update. If that is the case you can have connectivity issues, with the page failing to load in your browser. When you flush your DNS all the stored information on your PC is removed. This forces your computer to retrieve new data that will solve your connectivity issues.

## So how can you flush your DNS on your Windows 10 or Windows 11 PC?

1. ### Using Command Prompt  

   1. Open the Start Menu and in the search bar type`cmd` and select**Run as Administrator** .  
   2. Copy and paste the following command:`ipconfig /flushdns` and press**Enter** .

 Your Windows 10 or Windows 11 DNS cache should be flushed. You will get a message saying the operation is successful.
