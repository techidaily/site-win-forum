3. ### Update your drivers through the manufacturers website  

 Microsoft already has agreements with all notable manufacturers and includes the required drivers in regular Windows updates.  
 But, in rare circumstances, some manufacturers may issue special updates to address specific issues.  
 Although you can be quicker, they will also become updates for your computer.  
 That is why, in some situations, going to the manufacturer’s website and checking their Help page (typically) to acquire the most up-to-date drivers for your computer may be a good idea.  
 Below are the official download sources for the most commonly used drivers on Windows PCs:  

* [NVIDIA driver updates](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx)
