## Use Command Prompt to force quit a program

 There are cases when Task Manager is not enough as a method to deal with a stuck program.

 When this happens you need to use Command Prompt to terminate the unresponsive program. Here are the steps to follow:

1. Press Win button and type`cmd`
2. Type tasklist. This command will show you a list witl all the current running tasks and programs on your Windows computer. Find the unresponsive program’s name from the list.
3. Type taskkill/im program\_name.exe and press Enter.

 In the example below we want to force quit Microsoft Word. I will type taskkill/im word.exe and press Enter. If you follow all the steps correctly, the command will run successfully. A message should appear that says "Sent termination signal to the process Word.exe with PID 5972". The PID means the Proceess od which was defined by the Windows system.
