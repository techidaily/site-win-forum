## What are Registry Root Keys?

 Registry root keys are fundamental components of the Windows Registry. They serve as the highest level of organization within the registry’s hierarchical structure. Each root key represents a top-level category, and they are used to organize and store various configuration settings and information related to the Windows operating system and installed applications.

![screen of registry editor root keys](https://f057a20f961f56a72089-b74530d2d26278124f446233f95622ef.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/site/blog/what-is-the-windows-registry/registry-root-keys.jpg)

Here are the main registry root keys and their roles:

1. HKEY\_CLASSES\_ROOT (HKCR):  
   * This root key contains information about file associations and OLE object classes. It establishes the link between file extensions (like .txt, .doc) and the applications used to open them.
2. HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER (HKCU):  
   * This root key contains configuration information specific to the currently logged-in user. It includes user-specific settings such as desktop configurations, environment variables, and application settings.
