![screen of registry editor root keys](https://f057a20f961f56a72089-b74530d2d26278124f446233f95622ef.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/site/blog/what-is-the-windows-registry/registry-root-keys.jpg)

Here are the main registry root keys and their roles:

1. HKEY\_CLASSES\_ROOT (HKCR):  
   * This root key contains information about file associations and OLE object classes. It establishes the link between file extensions (like .txt, .doc) and the applications used to open them.
2. HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER (HKCU):  
   * This root key contains configuration information specific to the currently logged-in user. It includes user-specific settings such as desktop configurations, environment variables, and application settings.
3. HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE (HKLM):  
   * This root key contains information about the local computer system. It includes settings that are applied system-wide, regardless of the logged-in user. This key is particularly important for system-wide configurations and hardware settings.
4. HKEY\_USERS (HKU):  
   * This root key stores individual user profiles on the computer. Each user who logs in has a unique subkey here. It holds user-specific configurations that apply to all instances of their login sessions.
5. HKEY\_CURRENT\_CONFIG (HKCC):  
   * This root key is a dynamic link to a section of HKLM\\System\\CurrentControlSet. It provides a view of the current hardware configuration, which is used by the system at startup.

 Each of these root keys contains subkeys and values that hold specific information pertaining to their respective categories. These subkeys can further branch out into more specific settings and configurations.

 For example, within HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER, you might find subkeys related to software applications, system settings, and user-specific preferences. Similarly, within HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE, you’ll find subkeys for hardware configurations, system settings, and installed software information.

 Understanding these root keys is crucial for effectively navigating and modifying the Windows Registry. It allows users, particularly administrators and advanced users, to fine-tune system settings and configurations to suit specific needs. However, it’s important to approach registry modifications with caution and always back up the registry before making any changes to prevent potential system instability or errors.

## Where is the Windows Registry Stored?

 The physical files of the Windows Registry are stored in the**_Windows\\System32\\Config_** directory. These files are essential for the functioning of the operating system, and they hold different parts of the registry, known as “hives”. Each hive contains specific types of information, contributing to the overall functionality of the system.

## Summary

 In summary, the Windows Registry is a critical database within the Windows operating system, housing vital configuration settings for both the system and installed applications. Accessible through the Registry Editor, it allows for customization and modification of these settings. However, it’s crucial to exercise caution when making changes to the registry.
