9. Accessing Hidden Settings:  
   * Some advanced settings are not accessible through the regular user interface. The Registry Editor provides a way to access these hidden settings and make adjustments as needed.

 It’s important to note that while the Registry Editor is a powerful tool, it’s also one that requires caution. Making incorrect changes to the registry can lead to system instability or even prevent Windows from booting. Therefore, it’s recommended to back up the registry or specific keys before making any changes, and to only modify entries if you are confident in what you are doing.

## What are Registry Root Keys?

 Registry root keys are fundamental components of the Windows Registry. They serve as the highest level of organization within the registry’s hierarchical structure. Each root key represents a top-level category, and they are used to organize and store various configuration settings and information related to the Windows operating system and installed applications.

![screen of registry editor root keys](https://f057a20f961f56a72089-b74530d2d26278124f446233f95622ef.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/site/blog/what-is-the-windows-registry/registry-root-keys.jpg)

Here are the main registry root keys and their roles:

1. HKEY\_CLASSES\_ROOT (HKCR):  
   * This root key contains information about file associations and OLE object classes. It establishes the link between file extensions (like .txt, .doc) and the applications used to open them.
2. HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER (HKCU):  
   * This root key contains configuration information specific to the currently logged-in user. It includes user-specific settings such as desktop configurations, environment variables, and application settings.
3. HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE (HKLM):  
   * This root key contains information about the local computer system. It includes settings that are applied system-wide, regardless of the logged-in user. This key is particularly important for system-wide configurations and hardware settings.
4. HKEY\_USERS (HKU):  
   * This root key stores individual user profiles on the computer. Each user who logs in has a unique subkey here. It holds user-specific configurations that apply to all instances of their login sessions.
5. HKEY\_CURRENT\_CONFIG (HKCC):  
   * This root key is a dynamic link to a section of HKLM\\System\\CurrentControlSet. It provides a view of the current hardware configuration, which is used by the system at startup.

 Each of these root keys contains subkeys and values that hold specific information pertaining to their respective categories. These subkeys can further branch out into more specific settings and configurations.

 For example, within HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER, you might find subkeys related to software applications, system settings, and user-specific preferences. Similarly, within HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE, you’ll find subkeys for hardware configurations, system settings, and installed software information.
