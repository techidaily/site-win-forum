## Deleting files on Windows 10 with command prompt

 The built-in del command can help you delete files on Windows 10\. You have to point out the specific path to this file on your PC.

To use this method do the following:

1. Open the Start Menu and in the search bar type “cmd”. Right-click on the result and select “Run as Administrator”
2. Type in the field the following command where PATH will be replaced with the full path to the file you want to delete.  
**`del path`**

3. After that press**Enter**

Lets’ see this example to clarify the whole process:

 You want to delete a file called_Info.txt_ that is located on your desktop. Use the following command in the Command Prompt where you replace username with your own username:

**Del “C:\\Users\\username\\Desktop\\Info.txt”**

After you enter this command the file will be deleted from the Desktop.

 There are several commands that you can use to modify a bit the del command.

 For instance, you can add the /p parameter to the command to get Command Prompt to be asked for confirmation before deleting a file.

You can also add the /f parameter to force delete a read-only file.

 You can also use Revo Uninstallers’[force uninstall feature](https://store.revouninstaller.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=28010250&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1) if you have trouble removing stubborn programs.
