 Revo Uninstaller Pro allows you to scan and remove leftovers from different user accounts on your Windows computer.

### Improved AutoRun Manager

 With the Improved Autorun Manager, you can see a list of Windows Apps and manage their automatic startup for better System Boot speed.

### Improved leftover and scanning speed

 Another major improvement we’ve made is to reduce the loading times when loading and scanning for leftovers. The speed is improved by up to 30-50%. This is especially noticeable when uninstalling large programs.

### Batch uninstall of Windows Apps and Browser Extensions

 Revo Uninstaller Pro 5 allows you to uninstall multiple apps and browser extensions at once.

 Another improvement to the Windows Apps module is the functionality of batch uninstall. This allows the users to uninstall multiple apps and browser extensions at once.
