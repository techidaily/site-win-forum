### Command-Line support for Windows Apps and Browser Extensions

 In the latest release of Revo Uninstaller, we’ve made a few changes to the Windows Apps module. Aside from having the ability to uninstall Windows Apps via the standard graphical user interface, we’ve also added the choice of uninstalling them via the command-line interface (CLI).

 There is also now an option to remove Browser Extensions. You can do this from the Command-Line interface. Supported are all of the most popular browsers.

### Possibility to uninstall programs and apps for standard (non-admin) users

Standard user accounts can now uninstall programs and apps

 One of the biggest novelties in the latest release of Revo Uninstaller is the added possibility to uninstall programs and apps for standard (non-admin) users. This addition will enable users with standard accounts in Windows to uninstall apps, without the need for Administrator privileges.

### Scanning for leftovers for all Windows accounts when uninstalling programs or apps

 Revo Uninstaller Pro allows you to scan and remove leftovers from different user accounts on your Windows computer.

### Improved AutoRun Manager

 With the Improved Autorun Manager, you can see a list of Windows Apps and manage their automatic startup for better System Boot speed.

### Improved leftover and scanning speed

 Another major improvement we’ve made is to reduce the loading times when loading and scanning for leftovers. The speed is improved by up to 30-50%. This is especially noticeable when uninstalling large programs.

### Batch uninstall of Windows Apps and Browser Extensions

 Revo Uninstaller Pro 5 allows you to uninstall multiple apps and browser extensions at once.

 Another improvement to the Windows Apps module is the functionality of batch uninstall. This allows the users to uninstall multiple apps and browser extensions at once.

### Dark Mode to the user interface (UI) of Revo Uninstaller Pro 5

![Dark mode](https://f057a20f961f56a72089-b74530d2d26278124f446233f95622ef.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/site/blog/introducing-revo-5/dark-mode.png)

 Revo Uninstaller Pro 5 brings a new Dark mode to the user interface. If you prefer to use dark mode with your apps, you can now set Revo Uninstaller to match your preferences by enabling this feature.

### Customization options for most program colors

 If Dark mode is not your thing, we’ve got you covered. Aside from Dark mode, Revo Uninstaller Pro 5 now lets you customize most of the program colors, so you can make it look the way you like. To make this easier, we’ve added an extended color customization palette.
