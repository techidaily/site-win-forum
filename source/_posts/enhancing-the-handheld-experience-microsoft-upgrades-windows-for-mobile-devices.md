## Enhancing the Handheld Experience: Microsoft Upgrades Windows for Mobile Devices

Handheld console-like PCs running Windows are becoming more common, but Windows still isn’t really built for tablet-sized screens with controller navigation. Microsoft is now fixing one of the bigger headaches there: the Xbox Game Bar.

 The Game Bar is an overlay panel in Windows 10 and Windows 11 that allows you to record your screen, take screenshots, switch between games, monitor system resources, and other functionality. Microsoft is rolling out an update to the Game Bar for people in the Xbox Insiders program, adding a new “Compact Mode” interface that works better on smaller screens or when using a game controller.

 Microsoft said in a blog post, “With Compact Mode enabled, access to widgets and navigation is simplified to ensure you can get access to the content you want as easily as possible. When using a controller, you can switch between widgets quickly with left and right bumpers (LB/RB).”

 The Game Bar can still only be opened with the Win+G keyboard shortcut, or by searching for “Game Bar” in the Start Menu. However, most Windows handheld consoles (if not all) can map keyboard shortcuts to physical buttons. Microsoft suggests mapping a button to the Win+G shortcut if you want easy access.

 Most PC gaming handhelds ship with Windows, such as the [ASUS ROG Ally](https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/2024-approved-streamline-and-shine-the-top-5-video-quality-tools/) and [Lenovo Legion Go](https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/wire-free-wonderment-the-allure-of-m06-headphones/), but the operating system still isn’t optimized for that design. This is one of Microsoft’s first steps towards fixing that. There are still many other actions that will require tapping the screen or using an on-screen keyboard, but making the Game Bar work well with controller input is a step in the right direction.

 The new interface is still limited to people in the Xbox Insiders program, but once any bugs are worked out, it should roll out to everyone. Microsoft didn’t specifically mention if the new Game Bar mode is available on both Windows 10 and Windows 11, or just Windows 11—it’s connected to the Xbox app, which is available on both versions on Windows.
