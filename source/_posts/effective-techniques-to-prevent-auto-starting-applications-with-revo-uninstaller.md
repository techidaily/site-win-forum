### Scanning for leftovers for all Windows accounts when uninstalling programs or apps

 Revo Uninstaller Pro allows you to scan and remove leftovers from different user accounts on your Windows computer.

### Improved AutoRun Manager

 With the Improved Autorun Manager, you can see a list of Windows Apps and manage their automatic startup for better System Boot speed.

### Improved leftover and scanning speed

 Another major improvement we’ve made is to reduce the loading times when loading and scanning for leftovers. The speed is improved by up to 30-50%. This is especially noticeable when uninstalling large programs.

 Another improvement to the Windows Apps module is the functionality of batch uninstall. This allows the users to uninstall multiple apps and browser extensions at once.

### Dark Mode to the user interface (UI) of Revo Uninstaller Pro 5

![Dark mode](https://f057a20f961f56a72089-b74530d2d26278124f446233f95622ef.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/site/blog/introducing-revo-5/dark-mode.png)

 Revo Uninstaller Pro 5 brings a new Dark mode to the user interface. If you prefer to use dark mode with your apps, you can now set Revo Uninstaller to match your preferences by enabling this feature.

### Customization options for most program colors

 If Dark mode is not your thing, we’ve got you covered. Aside from Dark mode, Revo Uninstaller Pro 5 now lets you customize most of the program colors, so you can make it look the way you like. To make this easier, we’ve added an extended color customization palette.

### Improved and Redesigned Quick Uninstall
