   ![update drivers](https://f057a20f961f56a72089-b74530d2d26278124f446233f95622ef.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/site/blog/update-windows-10-device-drivers/method-2-step-4-update-choices.png)  
   5. If a driver update is available, the wizard will automatically install it, if not, your driver is already up to date.

3. ### Update your drivers through the manufacturers website  

 Microsoft already has agreements with all notable manufacturers and includes the required drivers in regular Windows updates.  
 But, in rare circumstances, some manufacturers may issue special updates to address specific issues.  
 Although you can be quicker, they will also become updates for your computer.  
 That is why, in some situations, going to the manufacturer’s website and checking their Help page (typically) to acquire the most up-to-date drivers for your computer may be a good idea.  
 Below are the official download sources for the most commonly used drivers on Windows PCs:  

* [NVIDIA driver updates](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx)  
* [AMD driver updates](https://support.amd.com/en-us/download)

4. ### Use the Compatibility Mode  

   1. Locate where the installation files of your drivers are.  
   2. Right-click on the drivers setup file and select Troubleshoot compatibility.

5. ### Via BIOS  

   1. Download the latest BIOS (or UEFI) from the manufacturer’s website.  
   2. The BIOS update file is usually in a .exe format, so you can copy it on a bootable USB flash drive. (Make sure you unzip the file before the move and double-check that there is no other file stored on the industry).  
   3. The next step is to insert the USB stick into the system.  
   4. To activate the booting sequence, press and hold the power button a few times.  
   5. Choose**Troubleshoot** .
