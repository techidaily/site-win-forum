##  Insert Multiple Rows in Excel With a Right-Click Menu Option

 One way to [add multiple rows](https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/new-exploring-the-perks-and-pitfalls-of-mcn-alliances/) in Excel is by using an option in Excel's context menu.

 To use this method, first, open your spreadsheet with Microsoft Excel.

 In your spreadsheet, select the number of rows that you'd like to add. For example, if you want to add four new rows, select four rows in your spreadsheet above which the new rows will be added.

![Select rows in Excel.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/1-select-rows.png) 

 Right-click one of the selected rows, and from the menu that opens, select "Insert."

 You will see a small "Insert" box on your screen. In this box, enable the "Entire Row" option and click "OK."

 To quickly remove the newly added rows, press Ctrl+Z on PC or Command+Z on a Mac.

 To use the shortcut, first, open your spreadsheet with Microsoft Excel.

![Select rows in Excel.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/5-choose-rows.png) 

 While the rows are selected, press Ctrl+Shift+Plus (+ sign) at the same time on a PC, or Command+Shift+Plus (+ sign) on a Mac. This will open an "Insert" box. In this box, choose "Entire Row" and click "OK."

![Select "Entire Row" and click "OK" in the "Insert" box in Excel.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/6-add-rows.png)
