## III. Enable Fast Startup

 Windows 11 comes with a variety of features that can help speed up your computer’s boot time. One such feature is Fast Startup, which allows your computer to start up faster by using a hybrid sleep mode that saves system information to a file on the hard drive.

Here is how you can turn Fast Starup On:

1. Press**Win + R** to open**Run** .
2. Type`control` and click**OK** to open the Control Panel.
3. Go to**System and Security** and then click on**Power Options** .

4. In the left pane, click on**Choose what the power buttons do** .
5. Next, click the**Change settings that are currently unavailable** link.
6. Under the**Shutdown settings** section, check the**Turn on fast startup (recommended)** option to turn on the feature.
7. Uncheck the**Turn on fast startup option** to turn it off.

8. Click**Save changes** to apply the changes.

## IV. Defragment your hard drive

 If you are experiencing slow boot times on your Windows 11 computer, one possible cause could be a fragmented hard drive.

 Defragmenting your hard drive in Windows 11 is a simple process. Here are the steps to follow:

1. Press the Windows key + S to open the search bar.
2. Type in “Defragment and Optimize Drives” and select it from the search results.

## V. Use an SSD

 If you have a modern PC running Windows 11, chances are that it uses an SSD (Solid State Drive), which is faster than a traditional hard disk drive. However, if you’re experiencing slow boot times, upgrading to a new SSD can help improve your boot time.

 In addition to upgrading your SSD, another way to speed up your PC’s boot time is to upgrade your RAM. With more RAM, your PC will have more volatile memory available to load temporary items, resulting in faster boot times and an overall improvement in your PC’s performance.

## VI. Adjust BIOS settings for faster Windows 11 boot time

 Adjusting the BIOS settings can help speed up the boot time on your Windows 11 computer. Here are the steps you need to follow in order to adjust your BIOS settings to improve your Windows 11 boot time:

1. Accessing the BIOSWe’ve covered in depth[how to access your BIOS settings](https://store.revouninstaller.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=28010250&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1) .
2. Changing the Boot OrderOnce you have accessed the BIOS, you need to change the boot order to prioritize the drive that contains your Windows 11 operating system. To do this, navigate to the Boot tab and find the option called “Boot Order” or “Boot Priority.” Use the arrow keys to move the boot drive with Windows 11 to the top of the list.
3. Disabling Unused DevicesDisabling unused devices can help speed up the boot time of your Windows 11 computer. In the BIOS, navigate to the Peripheral or Integrated Devices section and look for devices that you don’t use, such as serial ports or parallel ports. Disable these devices by selecting them and pressing Enter, then selecting Disabled or Off.
4. Enabling Fast BootMost modern BIOS systems have a Fast Boot option that can help speed up the boot time of your computer. In the BIOS, navigate to the Boot tab and look for the Fast Boot option. Enable it by selecting it and pressing Enter, then selecting Enabled or On.
5. Saving Changes and Exiting the BIOSAfter making the necessary changes, save your settings and exit the BIOS. To do this, navigate to the Exit tab and select Save Changes and Exit, then confirm your choice.

 In conclusion, these are some tips on how to speed up your Windows 11 boot time. By following these steps, you can optimize your computer’s performance and reduce the time it takes to start up.
