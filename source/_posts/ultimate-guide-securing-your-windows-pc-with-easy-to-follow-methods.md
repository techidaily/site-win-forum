3. Continue clicking the**Encrypt the File Only** option and click**OK** .

## How to encrypt your text file

 After password-protecting your text file, the next crucial step is to encrypt the file to ensure optimal data protection. Encryption is the process of converting the original text file into a coded format, making it unreadable to anyone who does not have the correct decryption key. By encrypting your text file, you can ensure that even if someone gains unauthorized access to it, they will not be able to read the contents without the decryption key.

 To encrypt your text file, you can use any encryption software that supports password-protected text files. The software will typically provide different encryption algorithms to choose from, each with varying levels of security. Select the encryption algorithm that best suits your needs, and proceed with encrypting your text file.

 It’s worth noting that a strong password is critical when encrypting your text file. A weak password could be easily guessed, putting your data at risk even if the file is encrypted. So, be sure to create a strong password and keep it in a safe place to ensure that your encrypted text file remains secure.

Some of the popular encryption tools are

* [VeraCrypt](https://www.veracrypt.fr/code/VeraCrypt/)
* [WinRar](https://www.win-rar.com/start.html?&L=0)
* [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/)
* [AxCrypt](https://axcrypt.net/)
* [BitLocker](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/turn-on-device-encryption-0c453637-bc88-5f74-5105-741561aae838)

 These tools will allow you to encrypt your file with a password. Choose the one that suits your needs and download it from their official website. Once downloaded, install the software on your computer.
