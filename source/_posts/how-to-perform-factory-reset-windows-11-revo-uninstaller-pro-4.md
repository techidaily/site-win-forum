## Step 3: Granting permission

 Revo App Manager requires a specific permission for general operation.  
 On the screen, tap**ALLOW PERMISSION** , which will open Android’s settings.

![revo app manager usage access screen](https://f057a20f961f56a72089-b74530d2d26278124f446233f95622ef.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/blog/how-to-install-and-activate-revo-app-manager/revo-app-manager-usage-access-screen.jpg)

 Locate Revo App Manager in the list, and tap it.  
 Secondly, on the new screen, allow the permission by tapping it.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![revo app manager allow permission screen](https://f057a20f961f56a72089-b74530d2d26278124f446233f95622ef.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/blog/how-to-install-and-activate-revo-app-manager/revo-app-manager-allow-permission-screen.jpg)

 Please note that the first launch could take a little while before you see the app’s home screen. The reason is that it is necessary for Revo App Manager to gather data about your device and all apps installed, which requires a more in-depth initial analysis.  
 Subsequent launches should be significantly faster.

## Step 4: Purchasing a license and Activation

 If you had decided to use the PRO functionality of Revo App Manager, this screen will allow you to select the subscription type you would like to purchase. Moreover, if you already have a Revo serial number (also referred to as “key”), you can enter it to unlock the PRO features:

* If you prefer to pay a monthly subscription, tap**MONTHLY** , and tap**UPGRADE** .

* If you already have a Revo key, tap**ENTER KEY** , enter your serial number (not case-sensitive), and tap**UPGRADE** .
* If you have changed your mind and prefer to use the freeware/ad-supported version, tap**CONTINUE WITH ADS** .
