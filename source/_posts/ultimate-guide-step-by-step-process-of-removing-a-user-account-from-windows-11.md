## First let’s discover what exactly is Wake on LAN in Windows 10/11

 As mentioned above Wake on LAN give you the power to turn on/off your computer remotely. By using the Ethernet connector a small “magic” packet is sent to the BIOS. This alters it to turn the PC on. For this feature to be active you need to connect your computer to the router using a wired Ethernet cable.

 As smart homes setups become more popular, Wake on LAN can be super handy. You can set up a voice command to turn on your PC using Google Assistant or Alexa.
