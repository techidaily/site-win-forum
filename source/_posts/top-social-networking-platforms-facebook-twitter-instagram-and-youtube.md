## So what will a factory reset do?

 The Windows 10 factory reset completely wipes out everything on your computer and reset all the settings to their defaults. Also referred to as Windows system restore it will remove all installed programs, files you’ve saved and created and delete all the installed drivers.

### Let’s take a closer look at the Factory Reset

 All devices come with a factory reset built-in feature. It doesn’t matter if you are using a phone, computer, tablet. It is used to erase the information that exists on the internal storage of your PC or other devices. The reason it is called a factory reset is that it restores the devices to their original state before they left the factory. It restores the computer to factory settings.

 Your computer settings will be reset to their default state. All the software products that you installed will be erased along with the information that comes with them. The default applications that come with Windows 10 installation will be reset back to their original settings. Once you perform your factory reset you can remove them again.

 We have covered how to remove Windows 10 applications in detail in[our article.](https://store.revouninstaller.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=28010250&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1)

### Why does the Factory Reset have its limitations?

 Nothing is perfect – the same goes for the Windows 10 Factory Reset. The truth is that the factory reset does not delete everything on your computer. The data that should be deleted becomes inaccessible. The data will keep existing on your hard drive. As you add new data over time, eventually the old data will be overwritten and it will cease to exist.

 A factory reset can create a false sense of security. You think all the data that you want to delete is erased, but in reality, it is still on your PC. If you want to permanently delete your files you can use tools such as[Revo Uninstaller Pro](https://store.revouninstaller.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=28010250&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1) and its Unrecoverable delete feature.

 We cover the topic of[how to permanently erase files here.](https://store.revouninstaller.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=28010250&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1)

 Before you start the Factory reset you need to do something very important!

## Backup your information

 Performing regular backup on your system is something your need to consider, especially if you will do a factory reset on your Windows 10 computer. As we said when you perform a factory reset the system will delete all your files, so it is important to back them up if you don’t want to lose important information.

### You have a lot of options when it comes to data storage

 If you only want to backup photos, files, documents, or any other files you can consider using a cloud-based backup service such as[Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive/) ,[Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com) , or[OneDrive](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ww/microsoft-365/onedrive/online-cloud-storage) . You can set up these services to save your data automatically. You will also be able to access your files from anywhere in the world as long as you have an internet connection. They come with free plans that offer you a couple of GB (gigabytes) of free space.

### There is always Windows 10 image backup feature to back up your entire drive

 If you want to save all of your information on your hard drive you need to use the Windows 10 image feature. Just make sure that you use an external drive to store your image file, in case you want to erase all your information on your current hard drive.
