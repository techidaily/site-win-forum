 Clearing your cache in Windows 10 can help you resolve some problems with your operating system.

## First, let’s discover what cache is

 Windows cache plays the role of a high-speed storage mechanism. The cache storage can be either a reserved section of the main memory or a specific independent storage device. To be more precise Windows cache is a hardware or software element that is used to store data.

 In computing, a cache is data that is stored locally in order to allow faster access to it when needed and/or to speed up load times by avoiding the need to perform a potentially intensive task every time, and instead performing once, and storing the information for later use.

 An example of this would be your browser’s cache. During your Web surfing, your browser creates cached copies on your drive of all sorts of data. When you re-visit a website, your browser can use the cached files to load it faster, as access to your local drive is quicker than downloading the same data from the Internet, especially if the website and/or if your Internet connection is slow. In such cases using cached data can be beneficial for users who have data caps from their ISP.

 Another example would be the icon cache that Windows creates. Each executable has its set of icons built-in. Windows creates its own cache of all icons and pre-loads it on startup to avoid reading each executable file’s icon separately every time.

## Why do you need to clear the Windows 10 system cache?

 Now that you have an idea what cache is, you need to know why you need to clear it.

 There are two main reasons for that: freeing up disk space and resolving issues that have arisen due to outdated or corrupt cache data.

[Freeing up disk space](https://store.revouninstaller.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=28010250&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1) may seem trivial and not necessary to be performed frequently, and to an extent that is true. However, remember that if you are using an SSD, it is a good idea to keep the free space on it as high as possible, as that can improve the drive’s performance and lifespan. That is why you should still consider deleting certain temporary/cached files occasionally.

 Since certain caches can become corrupt (e.g. the Windows icon cache) or outdated (e.g. browser cache), sometimes they would need to be cleared/deleted to fix certain problems, like missing/blank icons in Windows or certain websites not functioning properly.

### Clear cache in File Explorer

 Some of the caches related to Windows Explorer (also known as File Explorer), can be deleted easily, whereas others require slightly more advanced methods.

* **Windows thumbnail cache** : To clear the Windows thumbnail cache, open Revo Uninstaller Pro, click**Tools** , click History Cleaner, and then click Windows Cleaner. Check**Delete Thumbnail Cache** , and click**Clear** .  
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=195080&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img src="https://www.blumentals.net/scrwonder/images/screensaver-software.png" border="0">With Screensaver Wonder you can easily make a screensaver from your own pictures and video files.

* **Windows icon cache** : The icon cache cannot be deleted directly, as it is used actively by Windows Explorer and – thus – locked. We have created a CMD script file that will simplify the process.  
 Warning: make sure to save all your work and documents before you execute the script.  
[Download the file](https://store.revouninstaller.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=28010250&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1) to a convenient location, right-click it, and select**Run as administrator** . This will forcibly close Windows Explorer, delete the cache files, and then relaunch Windows Explorer. Your other programs should not be affected/closed, however, we recommended that all documents should be saved beforehand as a precaution.  
 Reboot your computer to complete the rebuilding of the icon cache.
* **Windows update cache** : This is another cache that is locked and requires a different approach. Again, we have provided a CMD script file that will simplify the procedure.[Download the file](https://store.revouninstaller.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=28010250&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1) to a convenient location, right-click it, and select**Run as administrator** . This will stop the Windows Update service, delete the directory containing the cache, and re-start the Windows Update service. Rebooting your device is recommended but not mandatory.
* **File Explorer history** : File Explorer also keeps its own history of all recently opened files and performed searches. These can be considered privacy concerns if you are sharing your computer with another person. To clear said history, open File Explorer, click the**View** tab, then click**Options** in the ribbon, and finally click**Clear** in the newly opened window.

### Clear System Restore cache on Windows 10

 System Restore is a feature built-in Windows for creating snapshots of vital Registry entries and files so that in case of an issue users can use a previously created restore point to return their computer to an earlier state. Thus, it is considered a good idea to create restore points before installing Windows updates, drivers, or more complex programs.

 You are allowed to set the maximum disk space used for system protection. When the allocated space starts running out, you might need to delete older restore points to create room for new ones. You can follow the below instructions to clear your system restore cache:

1. In the search field in the Taskbar type “Create a restore point” (without quotation marks), and click the found result.
2. From the list of drives select the system one, and click Configure.
3. In the new window, click Delete.

This operation will delete all restore points for the drive.

### Clear the DNS cache

 If you are experiencing problems loading a website, sometimes that could be to a corrupt or outdated DNS record on your device. If this is the cause, then clearing the DNS cache would be the solution, and it is a rather simple operation.
