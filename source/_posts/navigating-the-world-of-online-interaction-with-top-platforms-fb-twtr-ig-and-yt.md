 If you want to uninstall a program the usual way to go is through Windows Control Panel(Apps & Features). In some cases, the program you are trying to uninstall is missing from the Apps & Features list. In this article, we will show you several ways how to uninstall a program not listed in Control Panel.

## How to uninstall a program not listed in Control Panel

1. Check for the uninstallation file in the Program Folder
2. Use Revo Uninstaller Pro
3. Windows 10 Settings
4. Uninstall the program using the Registry
5. Shorten the Registry Key Name
6. Redownload the program and see if the uninstallation file is there

### Check for the uninstallation file in the Program Folder

 The majority of your software installations are located in C:\\Program Files or C:\\Program Files(x86). In the installation folder, there should be a file(uninstall.exe) that contains the uninstaller script. If you try to uninstall this program through Control Panel, Windows calls the same script.

 In case that the software is not listed in Control Panel, navigate to the folder of the program you are trying to uninstall and run the uninstall.exe file. This should remove the program from your PC.

2. Select the Registry key of the installed program.
3. Click**Rename** on the Edit menu, and then use a name with less than 60 characters.
4. To rename it, double-click**DisplayName** and use a name up to 32 characters in length.
