## Step 1: Installation

 You can download Revo App Manager from[Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vsrevogroup.app.file.manager.usage.permission.restrain.explore.optimizer.analyzer.scan.phone)

![installation page for revo app manager](https://f057a20f961f56a72089-b74530d2d26278124f446233f95622ef.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/blog/how-to-install-and-activate-revo-app-manager/revo-app-manager-install-page.jpg)

 To install the app, tap the**Install** button.

 Moreover, you can also open the Google Play Store link on your computer, and click the**Install** button. You will be prompted to select the Android device, on which you wish to install the app.

## Step 2: Welcome and thank you for installing

 When you launch Revo App Manager for the first time, you will be greeted with a welcome screen. Simply tap**I AGREE** .

![revo app manager welcome screen](https://f057a20f961f56a72089-b74530d2d26278124f446233f95622ef.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/blog/how-to-install-and-activate-revo-app-manager/revo-app-manager-welcome-screen.jpg)

 The second screen will prompt you to select if you wish to use the free (ad-supported) version or if you would prefer to upgrade to the PRO version.

![revo app manager thank you screen](https://f057a20f961f56a72089-b74530d2d26278124f446233f95622ef.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/blog/how-to-install-and-activate-revo-app-manager/revo-app-manager-thank-you-screen.jpg)

 If you want to upgrade to the PRO version or if you already have a Revo key, tap UPGRADE NOW, which will lead you to step 4.

 If you prefer to stick to the freeware (ad-supported) version for the time being, tap**CONTINUE WITH ADS** .

## Step 3: Granting permission

 Revo App Manager requires a specific permission for general operation.  
 On the screen, tap**ALLOW PERMISSION** , which will open Android’s settings.

![revo app manager usage access screen](https://f057a20f961f56a72089-b74530d2d26278124f446233f95622ef.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/blog/how-to-install-and-activate-revo-app-manager/revo-app-manager-usage-access-screen.jpg)

 Locate Revo App Manager in the list, and tap it.  
 Secondly, on the new screen, allow the permission by tapping it.

![revo app manager allow permission screen](https://f057a20f961f56a72089-b74530d2d26278124f446233f95622ef.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/blog/how-to-install-and-activate-revo-app-manager/revo-app-manager-allow-permission-screen.jpg)

 Please note that the first launch could take a little while before you see the app’s home screen. The reason is that it is necessary for Revo App Manager to gather data about your device and all apps installed, which requires a more in-depth initial analysis.  
 Subsequent launches should be significantly faster.

## Step 4: Purchasing a license and Activation

 If you had decided to use the PRO functionality of Revo App Manager, this screen will allow you to select the subscription type you would like to purchase. Moreover, if you already have a Revo serial number (also referred to as “key”), you can enter it to unlock the PRO features:

* If you prefer to subscribe to Revo App Manager for a year, leave**YEARLY** selected, and tap**UPGRADE** .
* If you prefer to pay a monthly subscription, tap**MONTHLY** , and tap**UPGRADE** .  
 Note: The prices will be displayed in your local currency with any additional taxes and fees included, based on your country of residence. For the annual subscription, you will also see a breakdown of the price per month.  
 Both of the above options will open a new screen where you will be able to use Google’s services to purchase the desired subscription.
* If you already have a Revo key, tap**ENTER KEY** , enter your serial number (not case-sensitive), and tap**UPGRADE** .
* If you have changed your mind and prefer to use the freeware/ad-supported version, tap**CONTINUE WITH ADS** .  
 Note: You can purchase and activate at any point later. To do so, open the main (drawer) menu by tapping the button in the upper left corner, then tap**REMOVE ADS** .
