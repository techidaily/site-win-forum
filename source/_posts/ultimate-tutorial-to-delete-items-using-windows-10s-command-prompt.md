### Method 5: Reset Virtual Memory in Windows 10

 Virtual memory is using your disk as if is RAM, by swapping temporary files when it runs out of actual RAM. Errors can start showing up in the_pagefile.sys_ and it can cause 100% disk usage on your Windows 10 computer.

 To solve this issue you will have to reset your virtual memory settings:

1. Open the Windows Start Menu and click on “PC Settings”  
![pc settings](<https://f057a20f961f56a72089-b74530d2d26278124f446233f95622ef.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/site/blog/fix-disk-usage/method-5-step-1-PC> settings.png)
2. Click on “System”

6. Make sure the box titled “Automatically manage paging file size” is checked. Press OK and then reboot. By doing this your system will inhibit the use of virtual memory and may improve your disk performance.

### Method 6: Reset or reinstall synchronization tools

 Tools like OneDrive or Dropbox sometimes take a lot of resources to synchronize all files. In some cases they get stuck and they overload your hard drive and push the disk usage to 100%. This problem happens when they are still trying to synchronize files after the process is done.

To reset OneDrive for example you can do the following:

1. Press**Windows Key + R**
2. Enter the command`%localappdata%\Microsoft\OneDrive\onedrive.exe /reset`

This should fix the issue and your disk usage should go back to normal.

### Method 7: Rebuild the Windows Search index

 Windows Search helps you find files, folders, or anything on your hard drive. To do that it scans your hard drive and turns into a super-fast index to show you your desired results.

 In some cases, the search feature can create issues as it keeps on indexing that can cause 100% disk usage and harm your hard drives’ performance.

To solve this problem you can rebuild the index:

1. Click on the Windows “Start Menu” button and in the search bar type –`indexing`  
![search index](<https://f057a20f961f56a72089-b74530d2d26278124f446233f95622ef.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/site/blog/fix-disk-usage/method7> - step1.png)
2. Select “Indexing Options” in the search results. Click on “Advanced” and hit the “Rebuild” button.  
![Indexing Options](<https://f057a20f961f56a72089-b74530d2d26278124f446233f95622ef.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/site/blog/fix-disk-usage/method7> - step2.png)

 This will erase and rebuilt the index and fix the errors that are behind the 100% disk usage in Windows 10

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Method 8: Run Disk Check

 Windows 10 Disk Check can identify and automatically correct file system errors which can be harming your hard drives’ performance.

Follow the steps to initiate a Disk Check:

1. Press**Windows Key + R** , type “cmd” in the Run windows, and hit**OK**
2. Type in the following command in the Command Prompt window –`chkdsk.exe /f /r`
3. Hit**Enter** and type Y to confirm the Disk Check the next time you reboot your PC. The Disk Check will start the next time your system start to boot and sometimes it can take quite a while to complete.

### Method 9: Stop the Superfetch Service

 Sometimes this service can cause problems and increase the usage of your hard drive.

 Similar to the previous step open again the Command prompt. Type the command:`net.exe stop superfetch` .

![superfetch](https://f057a20f961f56a72089-b74530d2d26278124f446233f95622ef.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/site/blog/fix-disk-usage/method-9.png)

### Method 10: Disable Windows Search

 There is a bug in Windows 8 and Windows 10 that can cause a search loop when you are using Windows Search. This can cause 100% disk usage and a drop in performance.

To disable the Windows Search follow these steps:

1. Open the Command Prompt(as mentioned in Method 8)  
![Command Prompt](https://f057a20f961f56a72089-b74530d2d26278124f446233f95622ef.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/site/blog/fix-disk-usage/method-10-.png)
2. Enter the command net.exe stop “Windows search”  
![windows search](https://f057a20f961f56a72089-b74530d2d26278124f446233f95622ef.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/site/blog/fix-disk-usage/method-10.1.jpg)

 This will temporarily stop Window search from running until the next time Windows is restarted.

 If you discover that Windows search is the reason behind your Windows 10 reaching 100% disk usage, you can disable it permanently by doing the following:

1. Press**Windows Key + R** . Type`service.msc` and hit**Enter**
2. In the Service window select Windows Search entry and double-click it to update its properties.
3. Select**Disable** under Startup type and then click**OK** .

### Method 11: Remove temporary files

[Deleting your temporary files](https://store.revouninstaller.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=28010250&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1) as we have covered in our previous article, can help you prevent issues. In some rare cases, bugs with temporary files can cause a Windows process or application to create a lot of files and increase your disk usage to 100%.

 Deleting the temporary files is a solution you need to look into to fix the problem.

## So what if the 100% disk usage in Windows 10 issue persists?

 If you can’t solve your 100% disk usage with the above methods, that means that you probably have to replace your hard drive. Your hard drive should never be at 100% usage. In case it is constantly showing this number there is some reason for the condition. If you don’t address the issue you are risking having a very slow computer.
