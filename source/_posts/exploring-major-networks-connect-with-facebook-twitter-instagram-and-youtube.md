Lets’ see this example to clarify the whole process:

 You want to delete a file called_Info.txt_ that is located on your desktop. Use the following command in the Command Prompt where you replace username with your own username:

**Del “C:\\Users\\username\\Desktop\\Info.txt”**

After you enter this command the file will be deleted from the Desktop.

 There are several commands that you can use to modify a bit the del command.

 For instance, you can add the /p parameter to the command to get Command Prompt to be asked for confirmation before deleting a file.

You can also add the /f parameter to force delete a read-only file.

 You can also use Revo Uninstallers’[force uninstall feature](https://store.revouninstaller.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=28010250&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1) if you have trouble removing stubborn programs.

## To delete folders in Windows 10 with CMD you have to use the rmdir command

2. Type in the field the following command where PATH will be replaced with the full path to the file you want to delete.

**rmdir “C:\\Users\\username\\Desktop\\Info”**

 If you want to delete all the files and subfolders in the folder you want to delete, add the /s parameter. This will ensure that the folder is removed including the subfolders and files in it.

## Conclusion

 As you’ve noticed, commands to delete files and folders in Windows 10 can be pretty handy if you have trouble deleting them the regular way.
