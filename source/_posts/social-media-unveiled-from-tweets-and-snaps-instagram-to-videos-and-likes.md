 Running low on drive space on your PC can lower your computer’s performance significantly. As your drives fill up with various files, your compter’s speed will slow down. This will affect all the daily activities that you perform – web browsing, streaming videos or simply checking your email.

 But don’t fret! If you are running Microsoft Windows 11, you have an easy way out of this situation.

 Windows 11 has several neat settings that you can use to get rid of temporary and system files or any other files that can fill up your storage space. Note that your important files will be safe as Windows 11 helps you decide what you need to delete to improve the performance of your computer.

## How to automatically free up drive space in Windows 11

1. Press**Win Key + S** to open the Windows search and type Storage Settings and click on it.  
![Storage settings](https://f057a20f961f56a72089-b74530d2d26278124f446233f95622ef.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/site/blog/free-up-drive-space/Method1-step-1.png)
2. Click on**Storage**  
 If this is the first time you go into your Storage settings, it will take several seconds for your PC to analyze your stored data. You will get full information about your files on your PC such as temporary files, apps and features, and others.
3. Turn ON the**Storage Sense** . By enabling this feature, your PC will automatically begin deleting temporary files, old downloads, and emptying your recycle bin when it is running low on space.

 When you turn on Storage Sense you will see a few more options. As we mention in the introduction, these options will help you determine which files are important, so you do not lose important information.
